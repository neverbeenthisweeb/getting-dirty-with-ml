we can use a kind of kernel to make our non-linear data into more linear

one of the example is -> radial based f (RBF)

every client has linear regression ==> easier to go for production

since everything is linear we could use bayesian estimator

very FLEXIBLE and INTERPRETABLE

models (GBF)  wont automagically make stuffs work!

to minimize error -> weighted linear regression | ridge regression | giving importance to error measurement
